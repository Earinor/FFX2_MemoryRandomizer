## How to run it

## FAQ
Will there be a GUI at some point?
- No, unless you write one yourself ;)

Can I contribute?
- Of course, I made this because I wanted a randomizer for this game, the better it gets, the happier I am.

Can I copy your code, or sell it?
- Look in the license file. You can do whatever you want, but being named would be nice of you.
