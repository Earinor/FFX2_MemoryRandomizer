# FFX2_MemoryRandomizer
A FFX-2 randomizer that randomizes gotten dressspheres in memory.

## How to run it
- To run the code either compile it yourself or get the published executable.
- Start your game, then start the exe. The program will attach itself to your game process automatically.
- Keep the application running while you play the game.
- That's it, have fun :)

One more note: The randomizer cannot randomize the intro (at least not yet). You have to finish the intro and once you are on the airship, open the menu and remove all dressspheres from the First Steps garment grid. This will remove the Dressspheres from your list and instead you will have the randomized ones.

## FAQ
Will there be a GUI at some point?
- No, unless you write one yourself ;)

What are you currently working on?
- A way to save your mapping data, so you can continue playing after saving and closing the game without randomizing everything anew.

Can I contribute?
- Of course, I made this because I wanted a randomizer for this game, the better it gets, the happier I am.

Can I copy your code, or sell it?
- Look in the license file. You can do whatever you want, but being named would be nice of you.
